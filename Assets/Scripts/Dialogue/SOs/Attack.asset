  - Simply charging toward your goals is never enough though, you fool! In order
    to lasso Lucifer, you'll have to start small and work your way up!
  - 'To be able to go bone to bone with ol'' Lucy, you''ll have to collect the bones
    of his underlings. Good thing you already have a bones #1 enemy: hammers! To
    throw your hammer at Lucifer and his underlings, use F.'
  - Once their bones are picked clean, make sure you collect the piles to keep scaling
    yourself, or Lucifer will crush you before you've even applied for your promotion.
  - I see one of His underlings up ahead! Go surprise them now!
